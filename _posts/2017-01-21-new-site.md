subtitle: Because wordpress.com is old and busted.

I hosted [theza.ch](https://theza.ch) on [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com) for many years. However, in the age of markdown and github, the Wordpress editor just feels ancient and unusable. 

So I'm joining the modern age and moving to [Jekyll and Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/). Now I can simply whip up a markdown file and `git push` to publish new posts. [Beautiful Jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) also seems to be a great, simple theme.
