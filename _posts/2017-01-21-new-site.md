I hosted [theza.ch](https://theza.ch) on [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com) for many years. However, in the age of markdown and github, the Wordpress editor just feels ancient and unusable. 

So I'm joining the modern age and moving to [Jekyll and Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/). Now I can simply whip up a markdown file and `git push` to publish new posts. [Beautiful Jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) also seems to be a great, simple theme.

While Jekyll seems like a super easy way to publish simple posts, sometimes I want to include an entire code project along with a blog post. I've found that the easiest way to accomplish this is in a dedicated github repo and its README.md. A good example is this [experiment with Flink watermarks](https://github.com/zcox/flink-repartition-watermark-example). I think I'll continue doing this, and whenever I do I'll include a short post on this blog that links to the repo.

I don't intend to move any existing blog posts from wordpress into this blog. To maintain support for existing links, the [jekyll-redirect-from gem](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from) is really useful. Now URLs like [https://theza.ch/2017/01/16/updating-materialized-views-and-caches-using-kafka/](https://theza.ch/2017/01/16/updating-materialized-views-and-caches-using-kafka/) are redirected to [https://zcox.wordpress.com/2017/01/16/updating-materialized-views-and-caches-using-kafka/](https://zcox.wordpress.com/2017/01/16/updating-materialized-views-and-caches-using-kafka/).

Now it's time to get to work and start blogging again!
