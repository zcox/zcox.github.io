title: Flink Repartition Watermark Example
---

This is a simple example that shows what happens in a Flink job when timestamps and watermarks from parallel source partitions diverge over time. Please see the full post, along with code, at [https://github.com/zcox/flink-repartition-watermark-example](https://github.com/zcox/flink-repartition-watermark-example).
